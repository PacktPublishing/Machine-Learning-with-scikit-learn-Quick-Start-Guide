**Classification, regression, and clustering techniques in Python**

## What is this book about?
Scikit-learn is a robust machine learning library for the Python programming language. It provides a set of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. This book is the easiest way to learn how to deploy, optimize, and evaluate all of the important machine learning algorithms that scikit-learn provides.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Learn how to work with all scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms 
* Install and set up scikit-learn to build your first machine learning model 
* Employ Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms to cluster unlabelled data into groups 
* Perform classification and regression machine learning 
* Use an effective pipeline to build a machine learning project from scratch

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

#Initializing an NB classifier

nb_classifier = GaussianNB()

#Fitting the classifier into the training data

nb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for aspiring machine learning developers who want to get started with scikit-learn. Intermediate knowledge of Python programming and some fundamental knowledge of linear algebra and probability will help.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-8).
